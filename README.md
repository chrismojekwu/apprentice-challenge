# Chris Mojekwu's Apprenticeship Submission for Tandem

## Goals
The goal for this submission was to demonstrate my grasp on creating Front-End Applications with React.

I tried to focus on features and details that made for a friendly and interactive experience for the user.

I wanted to keep styling as minimal as possible but still deliver an engaging interface.

Beyond the core requirements a user can save, access & clear a list of score cards from localStorage.

## Running the app locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chrismojekwu/apprentice-challenge.git
```

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm start
```

## System Dependencies
Node.js v12.19.0

NPM 6.14.8

React 17.0.1

(...should also work with any earlier versions within reason)
