# Chris Mojekwu's Apprenticeship Submission for Tandem

## Goals
The goal for this submission was to demonstrate my grasp on creating Front-End Applications with React.

I tried to focus on features and details that made for a friendly and interactive experience for the user.

I wanted to keep styling as minimal as possible but still deliver an engaging interface.

Beyond the core requirements a user can save, access & clear a list of score cards from localStorage.

** Note: I wasnt sure about altering after submission so theres a branch called touchups that has a few changed lines/1 extra test. (11/1/2020 5:30PM CT)
